## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I was mainly inspired by **Nkem Odeh-Ifeyinwa**'s "_Incognita II_" series, which presents the theme of "_Things are not always what they seem_" by **pixelating** the faces of people.I want to incorporate this expression method into my project because the assignment requirements are mainly for interactive effects and we choose the painting "Scream". I think through this effect, a certain part of the character in my painting can be **pixelated** to **highlight** this part, and then the theme can be expressed through the rendering of this part.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

I mainly use **p5.js**, which is a feature-rich **JavaScript tool library**. It provides functions such as image loading, layer drawing and interactive response, enabling me to quickly achieve visual effects such as **pixel decomposition and animation transformation**. For example, it provides **p5.sound reference**, which enables me to quickly complete the **input, analysis and synthesis of sounds**.
